# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

As a team, we want to create a respectful, supportive, and inclusive environment where everyone feels comfortable to contribute, learn, and share ideas.

## What We Expect

* Treat each other with respect.
* Communicate clearly, politely, and constructively.
* Share the workload fairly and be honest about your availability.
* Follow our agreed Git workflow (feature branches → develop → release → master).
* Record important changes and decisions in GitHub Issues or Pull Requests.
* Help each other out and encourage learning.

## What We Want to Avoid

* Being disrespectful, rude, or dismissive.
* Ignoring tasks or deadlines without letting the team know.
* Taking credit for someone else’s work.
* Refusing to collaborate or blocking progress.

## How We Work Together

* Use GitHub Issues to track what we’re working on.
* Give feedback in code reviews respectfully and constructively.
* Ask for help when stuck, and offer support when others need it.
* Keep the repo tidy and well-documented so it’s easy for everyone.

## Sorting Out Problems

* Talk about concerns openly and respectfully within the team first.
* If we can’t solve it together, we’ll bring it up with the module tutor.
* Serious or repeated issues may be passed to the course staff.

## Agreement

By being part of this project, we all agree to follow this Code of Conduct and do our best to keep the team positive and productive.
